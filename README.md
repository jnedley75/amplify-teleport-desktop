# *Unofficial* Amplify Teleport for Desktop

This is an unofficial tool which generates WireGuard VPN configurations for AmpliFi Teleport-enabled routers so you can access your local network from the outside. It was made because there is no AmpliFi Teleport desktop tool available yet, only mobile apps.

This project has been forked off a previous repository to give it a more user-friendly experience as well as a polished look.

Steps to use it:
 1. Download the latest installer file in the releases and run the installer
 2. Once running, click the hidden system tray in Windows (Bottom right up ^ arrow) and left-click the Amplifi Teleport for Desktop icon (Blue wifi symbol)
 3. Click connect and upon first launch, you will be prompted to enter in your Amplifi Teleport PIN. After submitting, you will now be connected
 4. To disconnect, simply press the 'Disconnect' button
 5. To connect again, simply press the 'Connect' button
 6. If for some reason you wish to re-enter another PIN, you can press the 'Delete existing configuration' button and clicking the 'connect' button will prompt you for a PIN again
